            <h1>PROJECT SUMMARY</h1>
            <p>TEAM Dog Rescueâ€™s website redesign aims to enhance usability by implementing a more user-friendly layout and navigation system to reduce user pain points. The goal is to increase adoption applications and boost donations, ultimately helping more homeless dogs find forever homes.</p>
            <h2>MY RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>User Research</li>
                <li>Lo-Fi + Hi-Fi Prototyping</li>

                <h3>WHAT I DID</h3>
                <p>In this website redesign project, I conducted user research, created user personas, developed Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi Figma prototypes, conducted user testing, iterated on the design based on testing results, and incorporated user feedback to enhance usability and align with the organization's branding.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h3>USER FINDINGS AND RESEARCH</h3>
                <p>A series of six remote moderated user interviews were conducted to evaluate the current website. Participants were asked introductory questions about their experience with animal rescue, followed by six tasks to complete on the website. After each task, they were asked the Single Ease Question to gauge their experience.</p>
                <p>At the end of the test, they were also asked to rate System Usability Scale statements to provide an overall assessment of their experience with the website.</p>
                <p>This comprehensive approach allowed us to gather valuable insights into their usability feedback, pain points, and overall satisfaction with the website.</p>

    <!-- Problem Statement Section -->

        <div class="container">
            <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
            <p>The existing website for TEAM Dog Rescue has usability issues that hinder user engagement. The website can be enhanced by aligning it with user preferences for user-friendly navigation and a simplified, yet informative layout. How can we redesign the website to improve the user experience, increase adoption applications, and boost donations?</p>
            <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
            <p>To address the usability issues hindering user engagement on the current TEAM Dog Rescue website, our solution involves a website redesign that aligns with user preferences. By prioritizing a user-friendly navigation and creating a streamlined layout, we aim to improve the overall user experience, increase adoption applications, and boost donations.</p>

                <h3>USABILITY TESTING AND FINDINGS</h3>
                <p>The primary navigation was iterated to eliminate the use of dropdown menus for the Us, You, and Them sections. This change improves user-friendliness by making it easier for users to click on the links. Upon reaching each page, users will encounter a secondary navigation bar that displays additional pages. During user testing, it was found that despite its simplicity, the navigation was not completely straightforward. Participants were unsure about which elements to click, overlooked secondary navigation, and occasionally lacked confidence in being on the correct page. System Usability Scale The SUS score had an increase of 11.5% after redesign</p>

                <h3>INTERACTIVE PROTOTYPE</h3>
                <p>Both mobile and desktop navigation was improved by providing a spacious layout and ensuring consistency between mobile and desktop versions. Updated design includes a drop-down menu that simplifies navigation, allowing users to access secondary pages by either clicking or hovering over primary navigation items. Furthermore, the inclusion of a donate option in every menu recognizes its importance and frees up space for more relevant information.</p>
